# This tracking means, if we copy these artifact along a pipeline, that we can
# track job dependency changes also.

# The default storage location for artifacts for the projects are chosen to be:
#JOB_ART_DIR=artifacts
# ...  which actually Jenkins job workspace/artifacts

# Unless another location is given?
